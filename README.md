# Pot It Like It's Hot

## Description
This application allows users to cultivate their own garden by picking and watering plants. Our inspiration for taking care of plants was by the tamagotchi toys which were fed regularly.  Given a specific time parameter, the user will water specific plants when needed. This project was our first MVC full stack web app. We used passport JS to enable session usage.

Once a plant has been selected, the user can then view their garden and water their plant. Each plant will show the time until the next watering and in which location the plant can be found in. Once a plant has been watered, then the water count will be reset.
